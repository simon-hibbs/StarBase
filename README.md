## Development
StarBase is developed in the Python 2.7 programming language, and is open source software released under the GPL version 2 license. The source files and associated data files are all available on Github from the following URL:

https://github.com/simon-hibbs/StarBase

There are plans to release a Windows executable distribution of StarBase, or you can run it from source on Windows or Linux.

In order to run StarBase from source or modify the code you will need a copy of the Python programming language and several third party modules for Python. These are:

Python 2.7
Pywin32 (Windows only)
PySide -  Qt GUI framework bindings for Python
NetworkX â€“ a network graph library

Starbase is tested on Linux and Windows. Optionally if you wish to build the application as a Windows executable yourself, you will also need:

Py2exe
